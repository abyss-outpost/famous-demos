#The Famo.us Demo code

> Acquired from: `https://github.com/EricLesch/famous` and `http://demo.famo.us` using `https://github.com/intuivo/intuiload`

- It is *somewhat* unobfuscated.
- It is *somewhat* tested for usage.

There are only two libraries (projects) that I couldnot seem to make it work, 
nor I wished to kept on fixing. 

I added sound the broken punch project to the batman yellow punch.
